%TODO:
% * Clean up Abstract for flow
% * TM marker on Suricata?
% * Focus on the intricate dependencies that GAN can learn as reason to research (Intro)
% * Helps us understand the limitations of GAN and why it's a good choice for complex alert data (Intro? Methodology?)
% * Illustrate the challenge, address the ways to go about it, show that it works (Methodology)
% * Fix figure demonstrating graph relationships

% * Methodology Should Be Independent of CPTC Data
% *   Define that IDS alerts are categorical, have large dimensionality, and identify features being used
% *   Definitely include figure with all the features of alerts
% * See Picture for Jay's recommended format of presentation

% * JSD Table
% * Table 5.3 Title: Histogram Intersection Scores Across 4 Target IPs
% * Table 5.3 Data
% * Fig 5.9 Values for WGAN-GP
%     * Replicate for all IPs, both models
% * Table 5.4 and 5.5 Values for WGAN-GP
% * Output Mode Capture Table
